# time2hike

A small but expandable project, designed to aggregate data from an area given by the user such as hiking trails, 
the general difficult of those trails and weather information-pertaining to UV index and potential flooding of the trails.

Features as the core components become implemented will range from 
simply presented information of local "Top 5/10/50/100 Hiking Trails" within the area given.

Along with information around seasonal closures; be that fires or rainfall depending on the area, as well as the possibility of 
official Govt. sites that report closures of local trails.

Later down the line I'm hoping to add in the functionality to choose between a preference 
for mountain biking, hiking, or maybe even camping, who knows!
